			<h4>IT Service Desk Consultant</h4>
			<h5>IT Service Centre - Education Queensland</h5>

			<p>
				As one of the IT service desk consultants, I was responsible for providing remote
				technical support via phone to a number of schools or regional corporate offices

			<h4>School IT Technician</h4>
			<h5>Mansfield State High School - Education Queensland</h5>
			<h5>January 2018 - April 2020</h5>
			<p>
				My role as a school IT technician required me to assist school staff and students
				with their IT issues. These issues varied from workstation deployment to basic
				printer troubleshooting. I was in a team of three other school technicians which
				required me to communicate and work well in a team to make our work efficient.
