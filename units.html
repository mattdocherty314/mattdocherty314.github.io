			<h4>EGB100: Engineering Sustainability and Professional Practice</h4>
			<p>
				As a part of studying this unit, I worked in a team to present a solution to a problem given by Engineers Without Borders. This involved understanding the project, looking at existing solutions and technologies and taking into consideration the cultural differences. The solution was presented as both an oral presentation and an engineering report.

			<h4>EGB111: Foundation of Engineering Design</h4>
			<p>
				This unit's primary project was a group project to design a crane to move a 500 gram weight over a distance of about 0.5 metres within a certain timeframe. Additional constraints were put in place that determined the final mark of the project. This project required teamwork, an understanding of the basics of mechanical, electrical and structural engineering in order to complete.

			<h4>EGB113: Energy in Engineering Systems</h4>
			<p>
				In this unit, I learnt the physics required in most engineering disciplines. This ranged from adding simple force vectors together to calculating the potential energy in the system to calculate the amount of work that can be performed. To assess this, multiple weekly exercises were given.

			<h4>CAB201: Programming Principles</h4>
			<p>
				The main focus of this unit was to introduce Object Orientated Programming to the students who haven't learnt it. C# was the primary language used in this unit which I did not know beforehand but I had a small bit of experience with Java which is very similar. The major project for the unit was writing a C# program that parsed DNA files.

				As the name suggests, this unit covered the security of IT systems. It covered the basics of how both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography works, the laws around data privacy and common vulnerabilties found with software. As a part of the assessment, you had to find five vulnerabilties with your phone, one with the operating system, one with a commonly used app, one with the use of the device and two others.

				When studying CAB303, I learnt the basics of IT networks, covering various different topics from the OSI network layer model to network security. We were also taught about how to interpret a Wireshark capture and how to use the different aspects of Wireshark. To test our understanding of the material covered we had various different forms of assessment, from a quiz on routing and subnets to an analysis and presentation on a potential attack on a network.

We also covered Fourier transforms and inverse transforms, Laplace transforms and their inverse. There were several reports that had to be completed as assessment for this unit to test our progressive understanding and a final exam to test our complete understanding.

				Introducing us to the main IT project management technique, AGILE, this unit prepared us for the capstone project that was to be completed in the following year. Not only covering AGILE but covering the basics such as, user stories, sprint plans and releases, DSDM principles and roles, requirements modelling and comparing the AGILE philosophies with the ones of PRINCE2 (waterfall). At the start of the semester we were put in a team where we had to apply what we learnt that week to a case study. My group didn't always agree on everything so we had to learn conflict resolution techniques as well.
