			<h4>EGB100: Engineering Sustainability and Professional Practice</h4>
			<p>
				As a part of studying this unit, I worked in a team to present a solution to a problem given by Engineers Without Borders. This involved understanding the project, looking at existing solutions and technologies and taking into consideration the cultural differences. The solution was presented as both an oral presentation and an engineering report.

			<h4>EGB111: Foundation of Engineering Design</h4>
			<p>
				This unit's primary project was a group project to design a crane to move a 500 gram weight over a distance of about 0.5 metres within a certain timeframe. Additional constraints were put in place that determined the final mark of the project. This project required teamwork, an understanding of the basics of mechanical, electrical and structural engineering in order to complete.

				Doing this unit we were taught the different aspects of an embedded system and some ways to work with them. This covered the architecture to how to work with threads effectively. To assess us, there were fortnightly labs, monthly quizes and a final exam. Additionally, the major assignment was to work in a team to develop a hypothetical electric vehicle embedded control system which utilised a Tiva TM4C1294 chip as the microcontroller board with a DRV832X motor board which controlled the motor and a custom QUT sensor board to get more sensors.

			<h4>CAB432: Cloud Computing</h4>
			<p>
				Completing this unit, I learnt about the way to deploy things to Amazon Web Services (AWS) correctly and the things to consider when doing so. The assessment required that two applications are developed and then deployed to AWS S3, AWS EC2 and other cloud technologies. The unit also touched on Docker deployment to make it easier to deploy apps on any system.

			<h4>EGH400-2: Research Project 2</h4>
			<p>
				In the final half of the year long unit, EGH400-2, I finished off the project started in semester 1. It assessed the same things as the first semester, however it was supposed to answer the question posed at the start. In the end, due to the reduction of scope, the final answer was still left unanswered but a prototype was successfully made and tested. To prove the learning outcomes, a final report and presentation was created.

			<h4>EGH444: Digital Signals and Image Processing</h4>
			<p>
				EGH444 demonstrated how to process images in various different ways. This varied from the traditional ways by using integrals or derivatives to apply sharpening or blurring to newer ways by using machine learning to classify images. The assessment varied from problem solving tasks to demonstrate specific knowledge to a final exam to show a broad understanding of the topic.

			<h4>EGH446: Autonomous Systems</h4>
			<p>
				In EGH446, various different subsystems used in autonomous control systems were taught. This varied from gyroscopes to LIDAR systems. The main assessment was to develop an algorithm that allowed a simulated vehicle travel between different waypoints while avoiding obtacles. The exam was to show an understanding of the underlying theory.
