			<h4>EGB100: Engineering Sustainability and Professional Practice</h4>
			<p>
				As a part of studying this unit, I worked in a team to present a solution to a problem given by Engineers Without Borders. This involved understanding the project, looking at existing solutions and technologies and taking into consideration the cultural differences. The solution was presented as both an oral presentation and an engineering report.

			<h4>EGB111: Foundation of Engineering Design</h4>
			<p>
				This unit's primary project was a group project to design a crane to move a 500 gram weight over a distance of about 0.5 metres within a certain timeframe. Additional constraints were put in place that determined the final mark of the project. This project required teamwork, an understanding of the basics of mechanical, electrical and structural engineering in order to complete.

			<h4>EGB113: Energy in Engineering Systems</h4>
			<p>
				In this unit, I learnt the physics required in most engineering disciplines. This ranged from adding simple force vectors together to calculating the potential energy in the system to calculate the amount of work that can be performed. To assess this, multiple weekly exercises were given.

			<h4>MZB125: Introductory Engineering Mathematics</h4>
			<p>
				This unit was advertised as a Maths C (now, Specialist Mathematics) bridging course it covered topics such as how to perform dot products and cross multiplication on matrices to how to work with complex numbers. Similar to EGB113, the assessment was weekly quizes to test our understanding.

			<h4>IFB101: Impact of IT</h4>
			<p>
				<i>Note: This unit is no longer offered.</i> In IFB101, I learnt about all of the different areas of Information Technology, both existing technologies and upcoming technologies. Some of these technologies were Big Data, Machine Learning and Web Design. In order to test our understanding, we had to research all about the new health system (at the time) called, MyHealthRecord.

			<h4>IFB102: Computer Technology Fundamentals</h4>
			<p>
				As a part of this unit, I learnt about a broad number of concepts about computer architecture. This ranged from the Von Neumann architecture to how an operating system works. The final project involved creating a program on a Raspberry Pi 3 that involved a hardware component and a software component. One example of this was the 'Magic Mirror'.

			<h4>IFB130: Database Management</h4>
			<p>
				<i>Note: This unit is now under the code, IFB105.</i> When undertaking this unit, I learnt the basics of how relational databases worked. This included the SQL syntax, how the different types of joins worked and wildcards. We also briefly covered other types of databases like NoSQL databases. As assessment, there were weekly quizes to test our understanding.

			<h4>MZB126: Engineering Computation</h4>
			<p>
				This unit covered a range of different topics that would be useful later on my degree. These topics ranged from solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to calculating probabilities of an event happening given some conditions and finally, I learnt the basics of MATLAB code. There were four short reports on the topics that we learnt that were given as assessment.

			<h4>CAB230: Web Computing</h4>
			<p>
				<i>This course was recently redesigned when I studied it.</i> As the main assessment in this unit, I had to create a NodeJS application to show the crime statistics data in a meaningful way. This required an understanding of how NodeJS works and how APIs worked, all of which were taught during the unit.

			<h4>IFB103: IT Systems Design</h4>
			<p>
				As a part of IFB103, I learnt about the principles of IT design from the low fidelity prototype to the high fidelity prototype and understanding how to get unbaised feedback. As the major assessment due at the end of the semester, my group and I had to prototype an app idea from ideation to a final prototype version shown in the Marvel app.

			<h4>IFB104: Building IT Systems</h4>
			<p>
				This unit provided an introduction to programming for most by teaching Python to all of the students. Being familiar with Python already, this unit showed me what programming assignments would be like at university. The two main projects that were assessed upon were a Turtle application that drew a Solitaire game and a Tkinter application that scraped the web for upcoming events.
